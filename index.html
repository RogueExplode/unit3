  <h1 title="Rogue Explode 001">Baiji</h1>
  <p> Baiji were chinese river dolphins that have been on the extinction list since 1998.<br/>
    They were originally from the Yangtze river in northern China, but in more recent years<br/>
   immigrated south to the Xi river and other river systems.</p>
   Baiji were predatory animals of fish and other small animals, and were closley related to<br/>
  the pink river dolphin found in Central America. These species of dolphins<br/>
  are the first to be driven to extinction by man. </p>
